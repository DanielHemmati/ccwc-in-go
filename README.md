# Build your own wc in go

This is my first project in Go.

## Why Dockerfile

I was really to see how does a Go project Dockerfile looks like, turn out it's really simple

## Todo

- [x] Add tests
- [x] Add benchmarks (see)
- [x] Add `--help` flag - it's already built-in when You use `flag` lib
- [x] Make a Dockerfile
